circleCi is a platform that helps in the process of creating a pipeline for continuously integrating newly merged code to the project and then publishing the entire app to
the end users.
we can configure a pipeline simply by creating a config.yml included inside a folder .circleci where circleci can find the config file and in turns execute the pipeline.
you can find more about circleci through:
